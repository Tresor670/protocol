  <!-- Section 1: HTTP vs HTTPS -->
  <section>
    <h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h2>
    <p>
      HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the original standard for transmitting data over the web.
      However, it sends data in plain text, making it vulnerable to hackers. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
      enhances this by using SSL/TLS encryption to protect the data during transmission, making it safe for handling sensitive
      information like passwords or credit cards.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> HTTP: <code>http://example.com</code> vs. HTTPS: <code>https://example.com</code></p>

    <table>
      <caption>Comparison of HTTP and HTTPS</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>

          <td>Lower</td>
          <td>Higher (preferred by search engines)</td>

          <td>Use Case</td>
          <td>Non-sensitive websites</td>

  <!-- Section 2: FTP vs SFTP -->
  <section>
    <h2>FTP vs. SFTP</h2>
    <p>
      FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring files between devices over a network.
      However, it sends data, including usernames and passwords, in plain text. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
      is a more secure alternative that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to encrypt the file and login information, making it ideal for
      secure data transfers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> FTP is like sending a postcard anyone can read; SFTP is like sending a sealed, private envelope.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Secure Communication Protocols</h2>
    <p>
      Secure communication protocols such as HTTPS and SFTP protect private and sensitive data from hackers and
      unauthorized access. They ensure data integrity, build user trust, and are essential in today's digital age for maintaining
      cybersecurity and compliance.
